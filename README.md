This interactive  application is designed to help students and practitioners understand the impact of violations of OLS assumptions on regression analysis. Through engaging visualizations, simulations, and interactive demonstrations, the app illustrates how issues such as nonlinearity, non-normality, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, multicollinearity, and endogeneity can affect estimator properties, test statistics, and inference.

Features
Comprehensive Overview:
An introduction to the key assumptions underlying OLS regression and why they matter for unbiased, efficient, and consistent estimates.

Interactive Demonstrations:
Explore each assumption violation with dedicated sections:

Linearity Violation: Compare linear and nonlinear model fits, analyze residual patterns, and view Monte Carlo simulations demonstrating bias in coefficient estimates.
Normality Violation: Investigate the effect of non-normal error distributions using Q-Q plots, histograms, and simulation-based comparisons.
Homoscedasticity Violation: Examine the impact of changing error variances on standard errors and confidence intervals, with side-by-side plots of robust versus conventional estimates.
Autocorrelation Violation: Visualize autocorrelated errors using the Durbin-Watson statistic, autocorrelation plots, and compare Newey-West robust standard errors with conventional ones.
Additional topics such as multicollinearity, endogeneity, comparative analysis, practical examples, and a summary quiz for reinforcement.
Teaching Tips & Guidance:
A sidebar provides teaching tips to help educators emphasize key points and suggest practical solutions to each violation.
